Write a python application that computes the number of minutes betwen two datetimes.
Generate a dict that contains 10 start and stop datetimes that you will use to test the application.
The datetime spans should range from minutes to years appart.  They should include a date, hours, minutes and seconds of various 
values to give us a good variety. Create a loop that loops over the 10 time ranges and 
computes the number of minutes rounded up to the nearest whole minute between the start datetime
and the end datetime.  Store the computed difference in the dict.  Convert the dict to a json
object and print the json object.
